        <p>As you might have noticed, São Paulo and Bellingham are very different, and that was one of the biggest differences for me. I really do like being in this kind of cities, just like BHam, but I also enjoy being in a big city with a lot of people and new places to discover all the time. At first, I thought Bellingham was little bit boring, but then I met some people that helped me with that. People were very nice to me, mostly. I started too go hiking sometimes and I do play a lot of soccer in my free time with the firends I made.Oh and the food is VERY different, which is something I still struggle on a daily basis, because the brazilian food is something I really love and miss everyday.</p>

        <p>Now talking about academic situations and expectations, it is also very different from the country I lived. The way of teaching is very different and I felt it was more efficient for me, in some ways. I guess I could say I´m doing a good work so far in college. I´m proud tht I changed right when I got into college, because I noticed I was on my own by that time, so I would need to study much more by myself, and that is what happened. The way the education is teached in the U.S pushed me to be less lazy and more productive, which I am today. The experience has been pretty nice for me, living abroad is something I would recommend to everyone to do at least once in a life-time. In <a id="pictures-link" href="campus-pics.html">this</a> link you can find some pictures that I took during this time.</p>
