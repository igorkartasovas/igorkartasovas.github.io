        <p>So it all started after I graduated from high school(2017), in Brazil. I was studying to get into college, and at that time I was convinced I wanted to major in Electronic engineering, just like my father. My family and I always wanted to go live in another place, and the US seemed like a good place o go, and by that time we had already taken a couple trips to the United States. The expericne itself is hidden in the image below, click to know more about.

            In 2018, by July, my dad offered me to try to apply for univeristies in the U.S, but before that I had no idea this would come, at all. Obviously I accepted to try so I started studying for it, and eveything went well. I had some options on different states to go. I chose Washington because it is pretty cool, the weather is nice, there is a lot of nature, which are things I like around me, most of the time, eventhough I also like to live in big cities, like São Paulo. I was very excited to go and live out of the country, study there and create a new life, in a whole new different place. I got in Bellingham in January 2019, and that´s when all started.
            I really like Brazil, specially São Paulo and the beaches we had on the north coast...living there was very nice and a piece of my life and story, so I´m grateful for it. I know it is just a normal story, but this is more about some of the differences between the two places.
