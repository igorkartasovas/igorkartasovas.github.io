            <strong><p id="iss-info-p">The ISS(International Space Station) is a modular space station in low Earth orbit. It is a collaborative project between multiple countries, involving five participating space agencies, which are: NASA(United States), Roscosmos(Russia), JAXA(Japan), ESA(Europe) and CSA(Canada). This station serves as a research laboratory, which is a space of conducting scientific research in fields as astrobiology, astronomy, meteorology, physics and others.

            <p id="crew">A typical day for the crew begins with a wake-up at 06:00, followed by post-sleep activities and a morning inspection of the station. The crew then eats breakfast and takes part in a daily planning conference with Mission Control before starting work at around 08:10. The first scheduled exercise of the day follows, after which the crew continues work until 13:05. Following a one-hour lunch break, the afternoon consists of more exercise and work before the crew carries out its pre-sleep activities beginning at 19:30, including dinner and a crew conference. The scheduled sleep period begins at 21:30. In general, the crew works ten hours per day on a weekday, and five hours on Saturdays, with the rest of the time their own for relaxation or work catch-up.[292]

                The time zone used aboard the ISS is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).[293] The windows are covered during night hours to give the impression of darkness because the station experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets per day. During visiting Space Shuttle missions, the ISS crew mostly follows the shuttle's Mission Elapsed Time (MET), which is a flexible time zone based on the launch time of the Space Shuttle mission.[294][295][296]</p>
