        <p id="text-left"> For this project, I´ll talk a little bit about how and why I ended up going to the United States for college. It has been a nice experience for me since the beginning, so I thought it would be nice to share some parts of it. First, my name is Igor and I´m an international student from Brazil. I like to play soccer, hanging out with my friends and I have an online sneaker store... if you want to check it out, click <a id="ig-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/plug.homies/?utm_medium=copy_link">here</a>. One of the reasons which led me to decide that my goal was to go live and study abroad was that I also really like trvaelling, so living in another country was considered by me a long-term travelling. Anyways, to know more details about the whole thing, click on the image below of me going to college abroad.</p>
