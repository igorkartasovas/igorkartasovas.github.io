            <strong><p>Besides playing sports and doing other things, one of my favorite hobbies is to trvel, whether is to the beach, the countryside, or other cities. I really enjoy going to the beach as much as I can, I just really like it. It is quite relaxing to leave the whole stress that big cities can bring to out mind, so going to the beach is always a good choice for me.</p></strong>
