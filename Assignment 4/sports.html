I´ve been playing football and tennis since a child but never really took tennis very seriously. I mostly played competitive football in school. My goal now is to get on the WWU football team. It was something I wanted to do right when I got at Western. I like sports but I don´t like going to the gym, I only go if it´s really necessary, so I hardly.  </p></strong> </div>

            <strong><p>However, tennis and football are very different sports. On one hand, tennis is a 100% individual, while football is collective. I don´t really watch tennis games on television, I just like to play occasionally. </p></strong>
