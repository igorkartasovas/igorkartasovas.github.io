    <p id="text1"> Some of my other hobbies are hanging out with friends and family, biking and hiking( not very much) and taking care of my business, which is more of a hobby  to me than a actual business. Also, I am really getting into computer science more, and more specifically I really like to learn about build webpages, even if I´m not very creative or good at designs, at all. </p>

        I don´t have many hobbies, during the pandemic this got worst, obviously. The learning has been my biggest hobby for the past few months. I thought to myself: well, I can´t go out and there´s not much to do at home rather than learning new things, which I´m curious about, so why not spend this time just studyin and improving the webpage for my online business? That´s one of my goals with this class, and I´m also interested in being able to build good and beautiful webpages for people.
